Want to try them now and not worry about installation/setup etc. A self contained Single Page Application (SPA) is available that you can quickly upload to a Sharepoint library and see the widgets in action. [**GO HERE**](https://github.com/purtuga/SPWidgets/blob/master/demo/demo.about.md#spwidgets-demo) for more information.

1.  [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

The following is an example that loads the required libraries from CDN's, the SPWidgets from the local site and then initiates the People Picker plugin on an input field inside a jQuery UI dialog.

                .appendTo("body")
                .find("input")
